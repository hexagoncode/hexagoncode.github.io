What is mush code?

Mush code is the softcoded scripting language that is used inside of a MU*.
I generally write for TinyMUX, but RHost, Penn, TinyMUSH, TinyMUSE, and a ton of others are out there.

It is sort of an exercise in masochism, because there are newer and more robust systems that rely on Ruby or Python. The "problem" with these is that it requires administrative access to make any coding changes so far as I can tell.

As long as a user has the ability to @create an object (and sometimes not even then, if they are willing to run the code on their player object), they can write mushcode.
