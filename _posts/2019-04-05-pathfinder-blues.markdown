I've spent more time thinking about this since I created these pages. I guess it gives me something to ruminate on. 

Here's the thing: Pathfinder appears to be the most ludicrously complex system I could have picked to try to model. It's cinematic approach takes everything awesome about every class and puts it all together. 

I just noticed that Gnomes are spellcasters. As a race. This is really cool, but now it means that "Gnome" is a caster class in addition to a race, but I'd have to hide that. I wondered if the same was true in D&D 5th Edition (referred to as 5E elsewhere in these pages). Forest Gnomes, in fact, know the minor illusion cantrip. I think this may be easier to deal with, because cantrips are pretty much at will and as often as you care to cast them.

So, I am going to take my progress on Pathfinder and get up to the same point on 5E while considering where to go with Pathfinder. I have played less 5E than Pathfinder, but this will be a good opportunity to learn. The game is certainly less complex, thanks to D&D 4th Edition's delve into tactical combat.

I expect bringing 5E up to speed to be simple enough. The harder part will be subraces, but so far as I can tell they only add traits and never change them.
