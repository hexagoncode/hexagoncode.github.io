I really should be using switch() for my room descriptions when they are "phased" depending on the status of whether or not attributes exist.

Pseudocode here:
```
if !_pf.statlock && !_pf.rolled?
    Roll some dice
    
if !_pf.statlock && _pf.rolled?
    Pick the rolled dice or use pregenerated dice.
    
if !_pf.statlock && _pf.rolled
    Assign your stats
    
    if race != human/half-elf/half-orc
        Race will receive bonuses... upon validation.
    else
        if !bonus
            Race is diverse. use bonus <attribute> to select an attibute to receive a +2 bonus.
        else
            You will receive a +2 bonus to <attribute> when upon validation.
    
    Type validate when you are done.
    You can type reset if you wish to start over.

if _pf.statlock
    Here are the stats you chose.
    You can type reset if you wish to start over.
```

Here's a good example of how switch() works:
```
&CMD-BONUS Step 3=
$bonus *:@switch/first [not(hasattr(%#,_PF.STATLOCK))]|[t(grab(get(#66/LIST_PF.ATTRIBUTE),%0*))]=

0|*,{@pemit %#=You can only set your bonus attribute before you [ansi(v(HCOLOR),validate)].},

1|0,{@pemit %#=[capstr(%0)] isn't a valid attribute.},

1|1,{@pemit %#=You set [capstr(grab(get(#66/LIST_PF.ATTRIBUTE),%0*))] as your bonus attribute.;@set %#=_PF.ATTRBONUS:[capstr(grab(get(#66/LIST_PF.ATTRIBUTE),%0*))]}
```
So, I check to see if it does _not_ have _PF.STATLOCK (I set this to 1 when finalizing attribute assignment). I insert a pipe, which is just a handy non-space delimiter, and then check to see if the attribute they are trying to give themselves as a bonus even exists in the list.

The first case matches if they do have _PF.STATLOCK and literally any sort of attribute. If so, you should have done this before validating. The validate command checks for this, so it's a state nobody should be able to get to.

The second case matches if you do not have _PF.STATLOCK and pick something that doesn't match an item on LIST_PF.ATTRIBUTE.

The third actually sets _PF.ATTRBONUS, but only if you are not validated and you pick something from the list.

The way I have the room description right now is four big blocks of code. There is some repetition in what I keep checking for. I should just check all the attributes I care about once, as soon as you trigger the description by looking at the room. 

So, that rewrite is on the docket for tomorrow.
